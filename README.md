# CodeChallenges
in this folder I wrote some simple exercises with their functional and unit tests

 - count_distinct_values.py: it counts how many times each iterable's value is repeated. I wanted to implement my own algorithm without using Counter class
 - get_key_from_value.py: an algorithm that shows how to retrieve a dictionary key by its value 
 - get_minimum_multiple_from_one_to_n.py: an algorithm to find the lowest common multiple of all numbers from 1 to n 
 - is_palindrome.py: it checks whether a string is a palindrome or not 
 - sorting.py: my own implementation of the quicksort algorithm without using the builtin sorted function
